Data Science Pipeline
Planning	
Stakeholders ask general or extremely specific questions that are difficult to answer
Who cares?/Why do they care?
The goal: Clearly define goals/ measure of success
The Deliverable: documentation of your goal
How to get there: Asking questions about what the final product will look like
What will the end product look like
What will the format be
Who will it be delivered to
How will I know when I’m done
What is my MVP (Minimal Viable Product)?
How will I know if it’s good enough?
-Formulating Hypotheses
    -Is attribute V! Related to V2

Acquisition
	-AKA: Data gathering, data import
	-The Goal: Create a path from original data sources 
	-The Deliverable: a file, acquire.py, that contains the the functions needed to 			reproduce the acquisition 
	-How to get there: 
		-Data scraping from websites
		-raw data from local flat files
		-using python library pandas
		-clean up or manipulation of data in SQL environment

Preparation
	-AKA: Data cleansing, Data Wrangling (acquisition + Prep)
	-The goal: split data into 3 samples, to learn a general pattern
		-Train
		-Validate
		-Test
	-The deliverables: a file, prep.py, from all 3 samples
	-How to get there:
		-Python pandas
		-identify and handle outliers
		-turn string into numbers (change data types)
		-plot distribution skew
Exploration and Pre-Processing
	-do exploration on training data
	-AKA: Feature exploration
	-The goal; discover the features that have the largest impact on the target variable
	-The deliverable: processes.py, with functions to reproduce the preprocessing
	-How to get there
		-Use python pandas, stats models, bumpy, Matplotlib
		-perform statistical testing
		-create visualizations between variables and targets
			-explore stage is where you find most of your takeaways
		-use domain knowledge to determine which features do and do not coincide with the goal

Model
	-the Goal: to create a model mapping features and target outcome
	-the deliverable: model.py, contains functions for the training model
	-How to get there
		-Create model
		-fit the model to training
		-predict target value
		-Evaluate how good that model is
		-repeat as necessary with other algorithms and hyper parameters 
		-predict on test
		-evaluate results on out of sample predictions 

Delivery
	-The goal: enable other people to use what you have learned 
	-The Deliverable
		-pipeline.py
		-fully deployed model on internet
		-reproducible report 
		-set of predictions
		-data dashboard 
	-How to get there 
		-python’s pipeline method
		-Tableau presentation
