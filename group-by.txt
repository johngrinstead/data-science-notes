similar to a SELECT DISTINCT query and order by
    group by unique values

        only thing that goes after group by would be a limit

from salaries;
    will count ALL salaries

select distinct salary 
from salaries;
    will return all unique salaries 

select * 
from salaries
group by salary;
    will return all unique salaries ordered numericaly (ASC)
