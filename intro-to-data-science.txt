Intro to Data Science	

Data: Digital representation of Information
Science: Applied scientific knowledge for formal sciences
Data Science: Formal, applied science that analyzes large amounts of data to provide meaningful information that can be used to make decisions and solve problems.
	-The purpose of data science is to provide actionable intelligence to make 			predictions

Common Misconceptions
	-Statistics
		-Statistics is used in Data Science but is only a small part
		-Data Science finds answers to questions using Statistics
	-Business Analysis
		-Rarely involves unstructured data
		-Usually work within spreadsheets/Data science takes info out of 					spreadsheets
		-Data science works with larger sets of data
		-light on “decision science” heavy on KPI (Key Performance Indicator) 				reporting
	-Data Science
		-No common understanding among every Data Scientist 
	-Python
		-Knowing a programming language does not make one a data scientist	
		
Data Products
	Product Recommendations
		-Recommended products based on other products you purchase
		-People who purchased similar items also purchased other items
	-Target Marketing: Banner ads or social media ads
	-Virtual Assistants: Alexa, Hey Google, Siri
	-Logistics: UPS shaved 20 million miles off routes after learning right turns take 			less time	
	-Business Operations: Predicting Churn
	-Product Management: Predicting life cycle of a product
	-Insurance: Liklihood of disease, auto accident, flooding for insurance premiums
	-Meteorology: Path a hurricane may take
	-Security and Defense: Terrorism, cyber attacks
	-Sales: Likelihood of engagement

Key Concepts
	-Algorithms
		-The foundation of Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep 				Learning
		-Recipes for computers
		-Series of repeatable steps to accomplish specific task of solve problem
	-Machine Learning (ML)
		-Helps computers predict outcome without explicit human input 
		-Process of “learning” patterns in a set of observations
		-Model then used to predict new outcomes
	-Artificial Intelligence (AI)
		-Began in 1950’s to complete simple tasks
		-AI does not always enable Machine Learning
		-Classic AI is unable to learn
	-Intersections of ML and AI
		-Once a program collects info with ML, AI can be used to create a new 				algorithm so ML can update it’s algorithm
		-Deep Learning (DL) is a subset of ML and AI that uses neural network 				algorithms, or Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
			-Falls under ML category

Supervised vs Unsupervised Machine Learning
	-Supervised Machine Learning: Uses labeled observations with a known 				outcome from human input to develop and model that can predict outcomes 
		- Answers == labels == supervised learning
	-Unsupervised Machine Learning: Does not rely on labeled observations
		-Learns differences through observations and assigns own labels
	-Reinforcement Learning: A subset of Unsupervised Learning
		-An “Agent” is incentivized to learn through trial and error
			-Positive and Negative reinforcement for desired and undesired 					actions

Structured vs. Unstructured Data
	-Big Data
		-More data than can fit on one laptop computer
		-4 V’s
			-Volume
			-Velocity
			-Variety
			-Veracity (Relevancy)

	-Unstructured Data: Does not fit in a predefined data model
		- Images, Emails, Videos, Audio
	-Structured Data: Can fit into a predefined model

Building Models
	-Data Modeling: building mathematical or statistical models that turn data into 			predictive and actionable information, can predict outcomes
	-Hyperparameter: A configuration external to a specific model
		-Not from estimated data/manually specified
	-Parameter: A configuration that is internal to the model
		-estimated or learned from the data model
	-Features: The attributes, x, predictor, or independent variable
	-Feature Engineering: Process of using domain knowledge of the data to create 			new features
	-Target Variable: The y, outcome, or the dependent variable, the “unknown”
		-What the program wanted to learn
	-Data Visualization	
		- 1. Explore data and understanding the meaning	
		- 2. Communicate to others

Programming Languages
	-Python
		-Object oriented
		-Top data libraries (numpy, pandas, stats models)
		-Easy to learn
		- slower speed
	-R
		-Open-Source
		-Optimal for statistic
		-Slow performance, not good for great amounts of data	
	-Julia
		-High performance
		-Very fast
		-Still early in development, not very consistent
	-Scala
		-Seamless integration with Apache Spark
		-Not easy to learn

Database Platforms
	-SQL: Structured Query Language
		-Structured data only
		-Business Intelligence 
		-Microsoft SQL, MySQL, PostgresQL, Oracle
	-NoSQL: Not Only SQL
		-Used for big data or unstructured data
		-Allows scaling
	-Graph-based
		-Social network analysis

Data Visualization
	-Tableau
		-Great for BI
	-plot.ly
	-D3.js
	-Matplotlib
		-2d plotting
	-Seaborn
		-Python Matplotlib
Data Governance
	-Spark
		-Written in Scala
			-Can use R or Python
		-Increasingly common
	-Hadoop
		-Original big platform data
		-Being replaced by Spark
	-Storm
		-Realtime processing

Version Control Systems (VCS)
	-Git
	-Github
	-Gitlab

Evolution and Trends in Data Science
	-Storage getting cheaper
	-CPU getting cheaper
	-Bandwidth getting cheaper
	-Data growing exponentially
